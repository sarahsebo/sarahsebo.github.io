      <p><b>Bio</b></p>

      <p>Sarah Sebo is an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://computerscience.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">University of Chicago</a>. Her research explores social dynamics in human-robot interactions, where a robot's social behaviors lead to positive outcomes for people. Dr. Sebo completed her Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale University</a> where she worked with <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/scaz/Scaz.html" target="_blank">Dr. Brian Scassellati</a> in the <a href="https://scazlab.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Social Robotics Lab</a>. Her dissertation work focused on developing robots that improve the performance of human-robot teams by shaping team dynamics to promote inclusion, trust, and cohesion. Dr. Sebo completed her B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href="http://www.olin.edu/" target="_blank">Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</a>. </p>


<!-- Elaine Schaertl Short is the Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Tufts University. She completed her PhD under the supervision of Prof. Maja Matarić in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California (USC). She received her MS in Computer Science from USC in 2012 and her BS in Computer Science from Yale University in 2010. From 2017-2019 she worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Socially Intelligent Machines Lab at the University of Texas at Austin. Elaine is a recipient of a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, USC Provost’s Fellowship, and a Google Anita Borg Scholarship. At USC, she was recognized for excellence in research, teaching, and service: she was awarded the Viterbi School of Engineering Merit Award and the Women in Science and Engineering (WiSE) Merit Award for Current Doctoral Students, as well as the Best Research Assistant Award, Best Teaching Assistant Award, and Service Award from the Department of Computer Science. At Yale she was the recipient of the Saybrook College Mary Casner Prize. Her research focuses on building algorithms that enable fast, efficient assistive human-robot interaction in schools, homes, crowds and other natural environments. -->

<!-- Henny Admoni is an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where she leads the Human And Robot Partners (HARP) Lab. Dr. Admoni studies how to develop intelligent robots that can assist and collaborate with humans on complex tasks like preparing a meal. She is most interested in how natural human communication, like where someone is looking, can reveal underlying human intentions and can be used to improve human-robot interactions. Dr. Admoni's research has been supported by the US National Science Foundation, the US Office of Naval Research, the Paralyzed Veterans of America Foundation, and Sony Corporation. Her work has been featured by the media such as NPR's Science Friday, Voice of America News, and WESA radio.

Previously, Dr. Admoni was a postdoctoral fellow at CMU with Siddhartha Srinivasa in the Personal Robotics Lab. She completed her PhD in Computer Science at Yale University with Professor Brian Scassellati in the Social Robotics Lab. Her PhD dissertation was about modeling the complex dynamics of nonverbal behavior for socially assistive human-robot interaction. Dr. Admoni also holds an MS in Computer Science from Yale University, and a BA/MA joint degree in Computer Science from Wesleyan University. -->
